## Cordel Roots

This repository contains the source code for **CordelRoots** - the Swift Playgroundbook for which I was selected for a WWDC 2019 Scholarship.

#### Cordel

The playground tries to provide an intruduction to the traditional brazilian literature style called Cordel. During its pages, I address topics like Cordel's most popular genres and sceneries.

#### Organization

As you will see, the code is very messy and unorganized. Honestly, I'm ok with it, and if you are thinking about applying to WWDC, **so should you**.
The WWDC submission is a half-marathon that got even shorter in 2019, as they reduced the days for the deadline. You project  will probabily not be updated or maintained, so I would not recommend spending too much time thinking about making things prettier. 
There is too much to do with a very close deadline. Anything that won't hinder your coding shouldn't worry you. Hard-code as much as you can - it is a 3 minutes experience.

A quote from Einstein to ease your mind:

> Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.
