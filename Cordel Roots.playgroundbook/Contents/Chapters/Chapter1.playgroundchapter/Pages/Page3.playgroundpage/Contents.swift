 ![Roots](rootsBanner.png)

 Celebrating our culture is a wonderful way of better knowing our __roots__. And by doing so, we are able to have a greater understanding of ourselves.
 
 We can create lots of knowledge by __reconnecting__ with the wisdom of our ancestors, and Cordel Literature is based a lot on that.

 - Experiment: __Run the code__ and connect the roots that are separeted from the tree!

 ðŸŒµ __Cordel Roots__ is near the end
 
 There's no need for feeling blue
 
 Was great having you here, friend!
 
 **Hope you've had a great time too!**
