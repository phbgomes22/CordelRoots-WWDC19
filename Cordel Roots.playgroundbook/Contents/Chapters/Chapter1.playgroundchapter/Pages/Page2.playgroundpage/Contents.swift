 Experienced cordelists very often become __repentists__: they are able to recite an __improvised cordel__ while still keeping its metrics and rhymes.
 
 But to do so, they must be very **quick on their feet** to find just the perfect word.

 - Experiment: Choose a theme to play with and try to find the rhymes that are missing.

 
 ![Lets Try](tryBanner.png)
 
 
 We all know the great effect
 
 That a rhyme does when it's heard
 
 **Slide your fingerüëáüèΩ to connect**
 
 The letters to form a word!
